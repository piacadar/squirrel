## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Import Data, echo = FALSE}
# Read dataset
squirrel = read.csv('squirrel.csv')
squirrel
```

```{r Split Data}
##Split data into categories
food <- squirrel[squirrel$Food == 'Yes',]
no_food <- squirrel[squirrel$Food == 'No',]
low_density <- squirrel[squirrel$Density == 'Low',]
low_density_food <- low_density[low_density$Food == 'Yes',]
low_density_no_food <- low_density[low_density$Food == 'No',]
high_density <- squirrel[squirrel$Density == 'High',]
high_density_food <- high_density[high_density$Food == 'Yes',]
high_density_no_food <- high_density[high_density$Food == 'No',]

```

```{r Experiment 1, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
